# Locally Simultaneous Inference

This repository contains code accompanying the paper *Locally Simultaneous Inference* by Zrnic and Fithian (2023).

The code implements locally simultaneous inference and several baselines: standard simultaneous inference, conditional inference due to Lee et al. (2016), and hybrid inference due to Andrews et al. (2019) and McCloskey (2020).

The repository contains notebooks with detailed examples:
